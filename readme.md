Banks issue loans, including those secured by real estate. For the company, this is insurance, and for the client, it is an opportunity to get more at a lower percentage. Each collateral object is evaluated: residential with the help of IT (for example, SRG group or "Mobile Appraiser"), but commercial â€” more often manually. No one has announced a full-fledged automated tool for evaluating commercial real estate yet. As part of the Raiffeisenbank hackathon, I tried to solve this problem. We had a team that had 2 people. I decided to try to modify the baseline solution and tried to use linear regression, while my teammate decided to try clustering. We even found a neural network that was written by a British bank for a similar task. It was clear that neural networks are not very well suited in this situation, but we decided to try it anyway. As a result, the score shown by linear regression turned out to be the best, and we entered the top 10 teams.
