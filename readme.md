# Raif

As part of the RaifHack hackathon, we did an assessment of the cost of commercial real estate. First, we implemented everything through baseline, that is, the baseline idea was to preprocess the data, and then use LGBM regression, with this we got an average speed. For the second idea, we wrote a small neural network and trained it on 100 epochs, trained it with batches. It works well and is well trained, but by the end of the hackathon we had a problem with the test on the final dataset, by the way, we did not throw the data into git, because their volume is too large and does not fit into the repository. The neural network was small, it had only 3 layers, but we got a very good score on the training data. The baseline model, that is, through regression, is located in the baseline/raif_hack folder and is called model_baseline.py , and a model with a neural network in model.py . You can see the instructions for launching and testing on the data in the files predict.py and train.py . You can learn more about the problem on the hackathon website and see our speed on regression, you can most likely in the same place, our killer coders team. Hackathon website: https://raifhack.ru/

If you want to see a normal solution through regression, which gave a good result, then look at the very first commit of the commit.
